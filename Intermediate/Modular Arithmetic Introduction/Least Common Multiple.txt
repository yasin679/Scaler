Problem Description
You are given two non-negative integers, A and B. Find the value of the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of A and B.

LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer divisible by both.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A, B <= 1000



Input Format
The first argument is an integer A.

The second argument is an integer B.



Output Format
Return an integer.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = 2
 B = 3 
Input 2:

 A = 9
 B = 6
Input 3:

 A = 2
 B = 6


Example Output
Output 1:

 6 
Input 2:

 18 
Input 3:

 6 


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 6 is the smallest positive integer which is divisible by both 2 (2 * 3 = 6) and 3 (3 * 2 = 6).
Explanation 2:

 18 is the smallest positive integer which is divisible by both 9 (9 * 2 = 18) and 6 (6 * 3 = 18).
Explanation 3:

 6 is the smallest positive integer which is divisible by both 2 (2 * 3 = 6) and 6 (6 * 1 = 6).
